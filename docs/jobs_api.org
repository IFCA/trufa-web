* Job Service REST/API

The job service is in charge of launch an execute the TRUFA web jobs. The web
comunicates with thi sservice using a http REST/API for a RPC like protocol
using JSON to pass parameters and results. Its posible to implement this service
to execute jobs on different platforms, systems, like clod, Grid, Slurm,...etc.

The params of the web service calls will be encoded on a JSON dictionary. And
the return also will be encode on a JSON dictionary. All returns will had the
~ok~ value with ~True~ or ~False~ to indicate if the call was rigth and in the
case the ~ok==False~ an ~errormsg~ string with the error message.

The four calls we need from the web are:

* get job status

Get the jobs status (~RUNNING~, ~COMPLETED~....) from a list of jobs.

#+begin_src
GET /jobs

params = {
    'joblist': [1,4....n]
}

returns {
    'ok': True,
    'jobs': [
        { 'jobid': 1, 'jobstatus': STATUS_1},
        { 'jobid': 4, 'jobstatus': STATUS_4},
        ...
        { 'jobid': n, 'jobstatus': STATUS_N},
}
#+end_src

* run job

Run a job. We design it to admit more than one workflow/program, but for our
case that parameter will be ignored or set always to ~trufa~.

#+begin_src
PUT /jobs

params = { 'user': username, 'program': workflowname, 'params': {...} }

returns {'ok': True, 'jobid': N }
#+end_src


* get job status

get the job status of a current ~jobid~.

#+begin_src
GET /jobs/[jobid]

returns {'ok': True, 'jobid': N, 'jobstatus': STATUS_N }
#+end_src

* cancel job

Cancel a job. You should notice I don't use ~DELETE /jobs/[jobid]~. Thats
because we don't delete the job, we only modify its state.

#+begin_src
POST /jobs/[jobid]

params = { 'cancel': True }

returns {'ok': True, 'jobid': N, 'jobstatus': 'CANCELED' }
returns {'ok': True, 'jobid': N, 'jobstatus': 'COMPLETED' }
#+end_src

it can return canceled status or completed status if the job is already done. Or
~ok==False~ if there someting wrong.
