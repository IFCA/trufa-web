>>> 1. Problem or problems to solve: You can tell here what kind of
    problems can solve the program. Or you can choose only one example
    and talk about it:

RNA-seq, also called whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing, is the
use of next generation sequencing methods to obtain a high throughput
of RNA sequences. Until now, analysing RNA-seq data remains
Bioinformatic challenge. This webserver is designed to make analysis
of RNA-seq data in a fast and user-friendly manner, by using cluster
computing and reducing the amount of Bioinformatic knowledge
necessary. So far, this dynamic pipeline is allowing you to perform
the following steps (programs used are specified in the parentheses):

- Reads cleaning: 
  - Quality trimming and duplicates removal (Prinseq)
  - Trimming adapters (Cutadapt)
  - Filtering out potential contaminants (Blat)
- De novo assembly of your reads (Trinity)
- Reads mapping (Bowtie)
- Contigs (i.e transcripts) identification:
  - based on sequence alignment (Blat, Blast)
  - based on protein dominions, profiles (HMMER)
  - Affiliation to GO terms (Blast2GO)
- Expression quantification:
  - providing FPKMs (cuffdiff)
  - differential expression analysis (cuffdiff)

All the steps of the pipeline can be run as a whole or independently,
depending on your needs. In the case of making a complete pipeline,
your reads files will be cleaned, then assembled into transcripts and
finally the transcripts will be identified and quantified.

>>> 2. Input, preprocessing: everything you need before using the
    program, like files or whatever (and if it's possible how to get
    these files).

The input files can be of multiple sources, depending on the kind of
analysis you want to perform and the data you have available. So far
the accepted inputs are:

- 1 or 2 reads files (paired-end or single) in fastq format.
- 1 file with already assembled reads, i.e contigs file in fasta format. 

>>> 3. Run program step by step: what you have to do to run the
    program: load files, configure everything, etc.

Essentially, all the steps of the RNA-seq pipeline on the webserver
can be realized with only reads files (1 or 2) as input. For the
purpose of testing and parameters tuning, later steps can be as well
directly performed with an assembly (fasta file with already assembled
reads).

First, you should specify and upload the necessary input files:
- For Reads cleaning:
  You will need one or two fastq files (i.e. single or paired end reads files)

- For Assembly:
  You will need one or two fastq files (i.e. single or paired end reads files)

- For Identification, you will need either:
  - a fasta file with the reads already assembled 
  OR  
  - 1 or 2 fastq reads files and generate an assembly (see How to generate an assembly).

- For Reads mapping:
  - 1 fasta file with the reads already assembled and the corresponding reads in 1 or 2 fastq files
  OR
  - 1 or 2 fastq reads files and generate an assembly (see How to generate an assembly).

- For Expression quantification:
  - 1 fasta file with the reads already assembled and the corresponding reads in 1 or 2 fastq files
  OR
  - 1 or 2 fastq reads files and generate an assembly (see How to generate an assembly).

Then, by specifying in the “Run a Job” part the type of input and the
input files, different possibilities will be available to you,
depending on the type and number of input files you specified.

>>> 4. Postprocessing: get result, get output files or whatever. You
    can say something about how to analyze the results, like tools to
    do so.
